1. There are three files and one directory.
2. assembler.c is the c language file.
3. Makefile can translate the c code into executable file, please typing "make" in the console, and it will set up everything for you.
	After typing "make", please typing "./assembler.asm -i ./tests/program.as"
	P.S: The command above will print the answer to the console. If you want a file, please typing:
	"./assembler.asm -i ./tests/program.as -o ./tests/program.mc"
	Notice: If you use debug test case, it will print error in the console instead of outputting to the file.
4. "tests" directory has ten .as files. Each file is a test case.
5. program.as is the example copied from canvas.
6. program2.as is another example which includes "nand" "sw" "jalr", make sure all instructions would work well.
7. program3.as debugs if there are any labels more than 6 characters long.
8. program4.as debugs if labels start with a number or a weird character.
9. program5.as debugs if labels have weird characters.
10. program6.as debugs if there are any undefined labels.
11. program7.as debugs if there are any duplicate labels.
12. program8.as debugs if the offset_fields that don't fit in 16 bits.
13. program9.as and program10.as debug if there are any unrecognized opcodes(instructions).
14. program11.as debugs if you are using instructions as a name of your label.
15. Please feel free to modify the debugger, they should catch any errors mentioned in the PDF on canvas.
